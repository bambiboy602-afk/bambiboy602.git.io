# B.A.M.B.I. Peer Support Services

> **"No judgment. No lectures. Just people helping people."**  
> *Belonging • Acceptance • Meaning • Balance • Inspiration*

Official web platform and interactive peer-support portal for **B.A.M.B.I. Peer Support Services**, founded by **Bambi** in Phoenix, Arizona.

This project delivers real-world recovery resources, product ordering for the **Pathway Domino Effect Recovery Game** and the **B.A.M.B.I. Participant Workbook**, community navigation (Housing, Work, Treatment, Legal Help), and **Tom**—an interactive, voice-driven AI peer support avatar running the **TOM CORE RUNTIME**.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. The 4 Support Pillars
- **Housing Assistance**: Emergency shelter bed access, Coordinated Entry via 2-1-1 Arizona, and CASS (Central Arizona Shelter Services).
- **Work Resources**: Resume rebuilding, second-chance employer connections, bus passes, and work attire.
- **Treatment Navigation**: 24/7 medical detox routing (Community Bridges Inc.), outpatient circles, and non-punitive peer groups.
- **Legal Navigation**: Resolving warrants, court payment plans, and driver’s license reinstatement to remove barriers to stability.

### 2. Featured Recovery Products
- **PATHWAY: The Domino Effect Recovery Game ($34)**  
  *Build the chain. Break the chain. Change the outcome.*  
  A hands-on board game for 2–8 players designed for treatment centers, sober living houses, and peer circles. Visualizes how pressure chains build (Barriers, Awareness, Mindsets, Behaviors) and how a single Intervention tile stops the fall.
- **B.A.M.B.I. Participant Workbook ($19 PDF / $24 Print)**  
  *Behavioral Adaptation & Mobility-Based Integration.*  
  A 6-session roadmap exploring the "Backpack and Load" exercise (identifying unspoken trauma and internal weight) and the "See → Sit → Move" impulse reset.

### 3. Recovery Video Library (`#videos`)
- **Multi-Source Embed Engine**: Watch recovery videos directly on the site, hosted on **YouTube**, **Google Drive** (`/preview`), or **GitHub Releases / Direct MP4s**.
- **In-App Theater Player**: 16:9 responsive playback with full-screen support, categories, and keyword search.
- **Interactive Discussion with Tom**: One-click "Discuss with Tom" sends the video topic directly to Tom's curb avatar for instant peer reflection.
- **Dynamic "+ Add Video" Form**: Allows Bambi to paste any YouTube or Google Drive share link anytime, with persistent local browser storage (`localStorage`).

### 4. Tom: AI Peer Support Avatar
- **Persona Archetype**: "The guy sitting on the curb at 2 A.M." A man of few words who notices patterns without drama, clinical jargon, or unearned advice.
- **TOM CORE RUNTIME**:
  - *Companionship Patch*: Space to process; companionship before guidance.
  - *Venting Detection*: Allows processing without prematurely offering fixes.
  - *Recognition Model*: Surfaces patterns gently so the user discovers their own answers.
  - *Stabilization First*: Grounds spiraling moments in present reality.
  - *Invisible B.A.M.B.I. Directive*: Guides naturally without clinical announcements.
  - *Sudo Tom*: Developer inspect mode activated by the phrase `"Sudo Tom"`.
- **Voice & Visuals**:
  - Browser-native speech recognition & text-to-speech with audio-frequency lip-syncing.
  - Multi-tier backend: OpenAI API (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), Gemini Flash (`GEMINI_API_KEY`), or an offline recovery knowledge engine.
